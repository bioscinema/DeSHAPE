Description: Provides a diagnostic framework for detecting distributional shifts in alpha diversity across biological groups. DeSHAPE supports testing for differences in location (center), spread (dispersion), and asymmetry (skewness) using both permutation-based and quantile-regression-based approaches. The framework also accommodates covariate adjustment to control for potential confounders. Designed for use in microbiome and ecological data analysis, where understanding full distributional changes is essential.
